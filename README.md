# Time Tracker

A React app for tracking work hours with start/end times or direct hour entry.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Usage

1. Enter task name
2. Enter hours directly (24-hour format)
3. Click "Add Entry"
4. Edit/delete entries as needed

## Assumptions

- Data resets on page refresh
- 24-hour time format (18:30 not 6:30 PM)

## Would Improve With More Time

- Add localStorage
- Implement live timer for current active tasks
- Task filtering
